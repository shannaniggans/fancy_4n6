|[The Hacker and The State](https://read.amazon.com.au/kp/embed?asin=B082DLMC6L&preview=newtab&linkCode=kpe&ref_=cm_sw_r_kb_dp_GJXQM5K5JS1ZMTW9FXA1)|Packed with insider information based on interviews, declassified files, and forensic analysis of company reports, The Hacker and the State sets aside fantasies of cyber-annihilation to explore the real geopolitical competition of the digital age. Tracing the conflict of wills and interests among modern nations, Ben Buchanan reveals little-known details of how China, Russia, North Korea, Britain, and the United States hack one another in a relentless struggle for dominance. His analysis moves deftly from underseas cable taps to underground nuclear sabotage, from blackouts and data breaches to billion-dollar heists and election interference.|
|[Psychology of Intelligence Analysis](https://www.cia.gov/resources/csi/books-monographs/psychology-of-intelligence-analysis-2/)|The Psychology of Intelligence Analysis has been required reading for intelligence officers studying the art and science of intelligence analysis for decades. Richards Heuer, Jr. discusses in the book how fundamental limitations in human mental processes can prompt people to jump to conclusions and employ other simplifying strategies that lead to predictably faulty judgments known as cognitive biases. These analytic mindsets cannot be avoided, but they can be overcome through the application of more structured and rigorous analytic techniques including the Analysis of Competing Hypotheses.|
|[File System Forensic Analysis](https://www.amazon.com.au/gp/product/B016N80EZ8/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_hsch_vapi_taft_p1_i0)|Most digital evidence is stored within the computer's file system, but understanding how file systems work is one of the most technically challenging concepts for a digital investigator because there exists little documentation. Now, security expert Brian Carrier has written the definitive reference for everyone who wants to understand and be able to testify about how file system analysis is performed.|
