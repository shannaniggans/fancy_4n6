# Section 3 - Lateral Movement
**Having found evidence of malicious activity on their web server, ALIEN are concerned about what the actor did next. Maybe they tried to move further into the network.**

# LM-1
*Shortly after dropping sample 2 on disk, the actor seems to have downloaded an interesting looking file. What process does this file relate to?*



# LM-2
*So the DMZ webserver was connected via DFSR to another host on the network. What is the hostname of the server that is linked to the DMZ webserver through DFSR?*





# LM-3
*DFSR? Doesn't that have something to do with moving files around? Could sample 2 have been copied onto another server? What was the filepath of the replicated folder?*





# LM-4
*So sample 2 was replicated onto CORP-WEBDEV, but we don't know if the actor were aware of the DFSR setup, or if they were able to access the replicated sample. Thankfully, ALIEN have provided data from CORP-WEBDEV for us to continue the investigation. What time (UTC) did the actor test their ability to interact with the copy of sample 2 on CORP-WEBDEV?*
