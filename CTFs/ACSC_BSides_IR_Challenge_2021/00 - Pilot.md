# Setup
So I could pretend to play along I setup an instance of ctfd locally in docker for windows.
1. https://hub.docker.com/r/ctfd/ctfd
2. Ran "docker run -p 8000:8000 -it ctfd/ctfd:3.3.1-release" to download the image locally, this was the version that worked for me when i imported the config.
3. Imported the provided ctfd_config.zip to my instance.
